Netflix has become one of the
most prominent global streaming platforms, continuously expanding its library
with a mix of original productions and licensed content. However, with growing
competition from platforms like Amazon Prime, Disney+, and regional OTT
providers, Netflix must strategically analyze its content catalog to identify
strengths, gaps, and opportunities. 



The specific problem to be
addressed in this project is 'Content Trends Analysis for Strategic
Recommendations'. The aim is to uncover how Netflix’s content distribution
(Movies vs. TV Shows, genres, and country contributions) has evolved over the
years. This will enable the identification of key genres, audience preferences,
and strategic insights into global content expansion.





Understanding Netflix’s
content trends is crucial for making data-driven business decisions. The
analysis not only highlights the balance between Movies and TV Shows but also
reveals popular genres and underrepresented categories. For a platform that serves
diverse international audiences, country-wise contributions provide valuable
insights into global representation and market penetration. 



By focusing on these content
trends, Netflix can refine its strategy for content acquisition and production,
ensuring that it caters to the right audience segments while staying
competitive in the global OTT industry.
